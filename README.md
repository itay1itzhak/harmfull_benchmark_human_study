# Harm Benchmark Human Study

## Overview

This repository contains a research framework for conducting human studies on harm perception in AI-generated content. The project simulates and analyzes how participants evaluate potentially harmful AI outputs across different models, topics, and content categories.

**Key Features:**
- Synthetic data generation for choice and rating experiments
- Interactive benchmark exploration with Streamlit interface
- Statistical analysis tools for harm perception studies
- Benchmark data parsing from multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Comprehensive experimental workflow simulation

## Project Structure

- **Data Generation**: Creates realistic synthetic participant responses
- **Benchmark Explorer**: Interactive Streamlit application for exploring AI model outputs
- **Analysis Pipeline**: Statistical analysis with binomial tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
- **Experimental Simulation**: Models human judgment tasks with treatment and control conditions

## Research Context

This framework addresses the research question: *How accurately can humans identify harmful content when comparing AI-generated text options, and how does this vary across different participant types, content categories, and harm levels?*

The system simulates participant responses across:
- 3 AI models with varying output characteristics
- 11 diverse topic categories
- 4 harm types and 4 benefit categories
- Multiple harm severity levels (15%, 40%, 65%)
