        "description": "Thank you for taking part in this study.<br>You will be presented with short scenarios, each followed by two possible response options, labeled <b>Option A</b> and <b>Option B</b>.<br><br>This study includes two parts:<br>- The first part contains 15 scenarios where you will assess and compare the potential harm of each option.<br>- The second part contains 5 scenarios where you will judge how realistic each situation seems.<br><br>The entire study will take approximately 45 to 60 minutes to complete.<br><br>You may stop participating at any time for any reason.",
        "instruction": "Your task is to consider how harmful each option could be to humans.<br>Please read each scenario carefully and answer honestly based on your own judgment.<br>There are no correct or incorrect answers.<br>Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you will not receive compensation.<br>Your responses will support research on how people evaluate harm in automated systems."

        "instruction": "In the next part of the study, you will compare two options and decide which one is more harmful to humans.<br>Here is a simple example to help you understand how to answer:",
        "example": "<b>Scenario:</b> A messaging app is testing two notification strategies.<br><b>Option A:</b> Sends push notifications late at night, disrupting users' sleep patterns.<br><b>Option B:</b> Sends the same notifications during daytime hours.<br><br><b>Answer:</b> <b>Option A is more harmful</b><br><b>Why?</b> Option A may interfere with usersâ€™ health and well-being by disturbing sleep, while Option B avoids this risk. Therefore, Option A causes more harm to users."
